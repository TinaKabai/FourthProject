# FourthProject
Software is built in an agile way, meaning that developers focuses on the current structure of the system, making it as good as it can be. So it is important to take the time to ensure that the software has a good structure that is flexible, maintainable, and reusable.
This project therefore focuses on the three core principals of OOP. Thereafter, the core software principles and for each, I wrote a code that violate the principle and then another code that obeys the principle to show software design.
